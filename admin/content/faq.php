                    <p>WallacePOS uses some pretty new & clever technology to enable offline processing of sales, refunds & voids.<br/>
                    Offline mode is available to users once they have signed into a device for the first time.<br/>
                    When in offline mode, new transactions and updates get saved into hmtl5 local storage, which is retained when closing the web browser. When the system detects a connection is available, it will attempt to synchronise these records with the server & other POS terminals.<br/>
                    You can take sales & orders in offline mode, as well as processing refunds, voids & updating sales notes for records that are locally available.<br/>
                    WallacePOS also allows you to perform all these actions for sales & orders that are still offline.</p>
                    <p>
                        Note: For security purposes, admin users must login in online mode before offline functionality becomes available. Locally available records can be adjusted via the admin dashboard, POS settings section.

                    By storing data offline to be readily available, and by receiving real time updates of that data, WallacePOS is able keep a its most used operations lightning fast.<br/>
                    On the terminal side, this means that staff can look up & add items very quickly. In fact, the terminal doesn't use the internet connection at all until the sale is processed.<br/>
                    The transfer of sale data is asynchronous, meaning that you can continue with another sale while the last one is transfering.</p>

                                    Device registration is simple, once off process for each device. Once registered your device is remembered with a special ID.
                                    Sometimes clearing extended browser cache can delete this ID, requiring the device to be re-registered.
                                    You can register multiple web browsers under the same device name, allowing staff members to use their preferred browser.</p>

                                    <strong>To register a device:</strong>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Browse to <a id="reglink" href="" target="_blank"></a> and login with your admin credentials. If your not an admin, get one to do this for you.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            You will be presented with a registration dialog.
                                            You may select an exiting device/location using the select boxes or create a new one using the provided text field.
                                            Once the form is filled, click register to complete the process.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Users can now login and take sales using this device.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>Note: If you would like to Change a devices location after it has been registered, you may do this via the admin dashboard (admins only).</p>

                        <li>Click on the green "Tyro Eftpos" button. This will initialize the card payment on the Eftpos machine and show you payment progress through the wpos terminal. Once the customer makes a successful payment, the sale will be automatically processed.</li>

                    Firstly make sure all connections are secure between the printer and the computer/network. If using a network printer double check that the device is connected to the network.<br/>
                    Secondly, close your web browser (along with WallacePOS), re-open it and log back in. Make sure the "Print-App Connected" status is showing in the bottom right hand corner of WallaecPOS.<br/>
                    Try printing by using the test button in the settings window.
                    If the printer still fails, power off the printer, computer and if using a network printer any network equipment such as routers and switches. Power the devices back on and wait a few minutes before testing the printer.
                    If it's still not working, please <a href="#!contact">contact us</a> and we'll work through it together

                    WallacePOS supports standard POS hardware.<br/>
                    Barcode scanning requires an android mobile phone with a camera (Android) or a USB barcode scanner (Windows,Mac,Linux).<br/>
                    Receipt printing requires an 80mm thermal receipt printer with ESC/P or ESC/POS (Epson standard code for printers). If you need 40mm support, contact us.<p/>
                    <p>Cash draw just needs to be a standard POS/electronic cash draw. This plugs into the printer using a phone-type plug.<br/>
                    Most of these printer are ESC/P but you should check before purchasing. Android devices require a network-connected model (Ethernet or wifi).<br/>
                    These two devices, being standard models, can be purchased cheaply off ebay. Printers can be bought for a little as ~$200, whilst cash-draws and scanners go from ~$60 and $~35 accordingly.</p>
                    <p>Scanner installation usually just requires you to plug the scanner into one of the USB ports on your computer. If you received instructions with the scanner, follow the manufactures directions.<br/>
                    No settings need to be modified in the terminal, you can login and scan items right away.</p>

                    <p>Cash rounding occurs automatically when all payments in the sale are cash and reverted if all cash payments are removed.
                    <br/>The rounding is set to the closest 5 cents (Aus standard) but we are planning to make this a setting in the future to cater for more countries.
                    <br/>If you need this set differently, let us know and we'll modify it to your needs.</p>
                    <p>Since taxes are calculated on a per item level, cash rounding occurs after tax is calculated and the total tax is not altered by the rounding.
                    <br/>The total rounding for a period is displayed in the tax report, allowing you to alter the tax according to your countries regulations.</p>

                    <p>Stock tracking is an automatic process that requires little setup and management.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Add the item that you would like to track if it not already present. This is done from Items -> Stored Items on the admin dashboard.</li>
                        <li>Go to Items -> Stock in the menu and click the add button in the top right corner of the stock page.</li>
                        <li>Select the item you want to track and the location of the first stock, any stock qty and click save.</li>
                        <li>The items stock is now tracked at that location and the stock level is automatically deducted as sales take place. <br/>
                            To track more items & locations, repeat the process above.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Once stock is being tracked you may transfer it to different locations, add more stock or set stock levels (stocktake).
                       The transfer feature will also start the tracking process for that receiving location.</p>

                    How can I export my data for external analysis?

                    WallacePOS provides a few ways to export your data, making it easy to use it the way you want.

                    CSV format is by far the easiest to work with. It's a human-readable text file that most spreadsheet applications open it.
                    You'll mostly find that you can open CSV with you current software but if not you can download a spreadsheet application by
                    heading to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice.com</a> (Windows,Mac,Linux) or <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets&hl=en">Google Sheets</a> (Android).
                    Spreadsheet applications are very powerful and easy to use with a little experience. They allow fine-control your data and most have some nice graphing functionality.

                    WallacePOS also allows you to export your data in SQL database format, using the database backup function in the utilities section.
                    SQL is a widely used format that can we converted and adapted for other systems.

                    Additionally you may like to use the WallacePOS API to access JSON data. An API guide will be coming soon.
